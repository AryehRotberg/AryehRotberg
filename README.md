Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aryeh Rotberg, a computer science student with practical experience in natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and machine learning. Building models from the ground up, comprehending the fundamental ideas of AI, and refining algorithms for practical uses are my areas of passion.

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning: I have experience with a variety of projects that include Siamese networks, named entity recognition (NER), text classification, sentiment analysis, and triplet loss optimization. I have used PyTorch and TensorFlow to implement deep learning architectures, frequently choosing to create models from the ground up in order to better comprehend their workings.

- Natural Language Processing: I am skilled in text summarization, custom tokenization, and translation systems. I have improved model performance for long-text by fine-tuning transformers like Pegasus to handle large documents.

- Data Science & Optimization: I've worked with TF-IDF, feature engineering, embedding models, and optimizing Python and Java functions for computational efficiency. For improved model evaluation, I also created unique loss functions and masked accuracy metrics.

- Software Development & Research: I like to implement basic algorithms from scratch and recreate frameworks like PyTorch in C++, so I don't just rely on libraries. My knowledge of neural networks, computational efficiency, and AI systems design is enhanced by this practical approach.

Always willing to learn new things and work with others on cutting-edge AI problems. Let's get in touch!
